- 1.Write a lambda expression to get the productof two numbers.
- 2.Write a function to get the area of a circle from the radius.
-   Hint: remember to import the right modul for being able to calculte the area of the circle.
- 3.Build a simple calculator which can:add, subtract, multiply, divide.
-   Hint: solve by writing a function that takes as argument two numbers and the operation and returns the desired output.
-   Run test for function(2,5,’d’)
- 4.Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width.The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.
-   Run test for r = Rectangle(5,10)
- 5.Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square.
-   Shapeobjects can be consrtucted by name andlengthhas an area function wich return 0
-   Square subclass has an init function which take a length and name as argumentand has anarea method and a describe method what prints the name of the Shape
-   Print the area from Square class.
-   Run test for:s = Square('square',5)
-   print(s.area())
-   print(s.describe())
